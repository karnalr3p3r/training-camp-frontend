                  The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between
                  the IMC and the militia founded to fight them, the region of
                  space known as the Frontier can finally see peace. But
                  liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left
                  barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to nothing. With
                  no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice
                  but to leave their homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands.
                  A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the Frontier,
                  the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with resources
                  and opportunity. But life is cheap here, and danger lurks
                  around every corner. Its pioneers, explorers, and outlaws used
                  to spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle now,
                  they settle their differences in the Apex Games, a bloodsport
                  where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for
                  money, fame, and glory.

                  The Apex Games were initially hosted on Kings Canyon, an
                  island located on the planet Solace. Construction of the arena
                  for the games commenced some time in 2727 and was finished a
                  year after, after which time the games presumably started. The
                  arena at Kings Canyon has been used for 124 seasons, until an
                  attack on the island's Repulsor Tower by Crypto allowed the
                  entry of wildlife, resulting in a devastated arena. The match,
                  then in-progress, was halted and the legends evacuated. The
                  Syndicate suspended the games after the attack and proceeded
                  to make various modifications to the arena in order to
                  increase viewership and contain the wildlife that invaded the
                  island. Various disturbances were reported within the arena,
                  following the resumption of the games, which forced the
                  Syndicate to relocate the games to World's Edge, another arena
                  on the planet Talos. Following this move, a sponsorship was
                  struck up with the "new" Hammond Robotics, one of the
                  companies that used to make up the now-defunct IMC. This
                  coincided with the entry of Forge, a legend sponsored by
                  Hammond Robotics and the introduction of the Planetary
                  Harvester to World's Edge. Before his entry into the games,
                  however, he was assassinated by Revenant. This, alongside the
                  various reported break-ins on Hammond facilities and the fact
                  that Revenant has a vendetta against both the Syndicate and
                  Hammond, Jacob Young and Cheryl Amacci found a way to contain
                  the simulacrum by allowing him to join the games.
